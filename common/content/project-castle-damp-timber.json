  "about": "This project was to update an old and outdated website with a more modern one for a company called Castle Damp and Timber. Firstly, I had to design the user interface, this process included gathering user requirements and getting inspiration from other websites. After that I produced mobile and desktop designs and then worked with the client to refine them to their liking. I then created the website using vanilla HTML, CSS and JavaScript.",

    { "name": "animejs", "type": "frontend", "about": "was the animation library I used for the project. It was lightweight and easy to use, it allowed me to make custom animations for different parts of the site such as the menu and for certain buttons which the user could press and find more information. As the menu acted differently depending on the user screen size, AnimeJs helped me handle the different animations that were needed." },
    { "name": "Adobe XD", "type": "frontend", "about": "helped with the designing the site, it allowed me to create design boards with examples of user interfaces that I thought would work well on other websites. Adobe XD allowed me to have all of these designs next to each other so I could compare them and take inspiration from them. Using a tool like Adobe XD also allowed for prototyping so I could test the flow of the site I was making to ensure that information was easy to find." }

      "about": "Basic contact us page where the user of the site has to fill out a short form and then can submit a message. The form would take all the data and create an email which would be sent to the owner of the company. In addition there was good visual feedback in the form to see what inputs were filled in incorrectly and a notification on success or failure of the submission."

      "about": "The most important part of this project was to ensure that the user could access all the information they needed easily and quickly and ensuring that the content adapted to the user's screen size. A good mobile design was achieved by doing a mobile first approach, it was also easy to work from a mobile design and make the appropriate changes to make it usable on the desktop."

                                I was born in the United Kingdom in the city of Derby. Ever since I first started using a computer I wanted to be able to write code. After finishing school and then sixth form I went to the University of Lincoln to study computer science. In 2019 I graduated with a first class degree. Shortly after finishing university I landed my first and current job at Iventis as a graduate software engineer.

                                I primarily focus my work time writing front end code to help build the great products we offer at Iventis. I have a lot of experience with frameworks such as React and Angular and love anything TypeScript. I enjoy dabbling in code outside of work as well, I try to post as much as I can on my <Link onClick={() => onLinkClick(blogPage)}>blog</Link> and I really enjoy  building things, it is my favourite part of being a software engineer, we can build whatever with whatever technology we choose. When I am not at my desk I love walking, going out and sports, specifically football and cricket.

                                I have no idea what my future is going to holdâ€¦ if I did it would be rather boring. Hopefully I will be working my way down the list of tech I want to learn and building some useful and interesting apps. You can check out my <Link onClick={() => onLinkClick(projectsPage)}>projects page</Link> to see what I have built recently and what I am currently building.
